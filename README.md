<p>This was an individual school project and the first time we got familiar to work with ganache, solidity, web3 and metamask.</p><br>
<p>Its a simple todolist but you need to connect to ganache with your metamask wallet and confirm the todos you want to save, change or delete from the ganache test blockchain.</p>
